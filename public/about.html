<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>The beginning</h2>
<p>
  I started my young life on the farm, tended cattle in the break of daylight
  and other farm duties. I since then started to develop the love for the farm,
  the animals and the way that such a beautiful living can become a bussines.
</p>
<h2>The Semi-Middle</h2>
<p>
  We moved to town as our farm were taken away, the new economy wasn't for us,
  so I started to go to school in town. My High School career was at Monument
  High, Krugersdorp. I played a bit of rugby, participated in athletics and
  science, but science was not for me.
</p>
<h2>The Middle</h2>
<p>
  After finishing High School, I decided to go study Agriculture at the
  Agriculture College of Potchefstroom, unfortunately it did not work ou. I met
  a couple of friends in the 2 years I studied who lived and worked on farms, so
  every holiday/ off-season, I went to multiple farms in the Kwa-Zulu Natal
  district to lend a helping hand
</p>

<p>
  Unfortunately with the high risks of living and working on a farm, I left the
  farm to come back to town. I started to gain a like in how programs work, how
  the internet fetches certain pages for us, amount of ping on a webpage.
</p>

<p>
  After months of the research adventure, I ended up studying at Hyperion
  Developemnt, Software Engineer Bootcamp. After completion I got the like in
  how to build webpages, but with apps, and so forth.
</p>

<p>
  After completing my Bootcamp, 97% Average Grade, the bug bit me into designing
  webpages, how they work, the transcrips, transparency, hovers and all the
  animations that goes part in developing a web page.
</p>

<h2>Present</h2>

  Currently I am studying Full Stack Web Development at Udemy, so far all is
  going good and I am starting to really get a like into web development! Stay
  tuned to see more of my projects and info on this page!
